Currently, I am working on developing a sophisticated recommender system designed to match user profiles with job descriptions, leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and collaborative filtering techniques. My role involves end-to-end ownership of the project, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

            With a solid foundation in Computer Science, I bring 4 years of experience in designing and implementing machine learning solutions that drive real-world impact. My expertise includes working with large-scale datasets, optimizing recommendation algorithms, and deploying models into production environments using cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. I am proficient in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn, and have hands-on experience with tools like Spark and Docker for scalable data processing and deployment.

            In my current project, I am focused on improving the accuracy and personalization of job recommendations by incorporating user behavior data, contextual information, and advanced NLP techniques to better understand both user profiles and job descriptions. This involves experimenting with deep learning architectures, such as BERT-based models, and continuously iterating to enhance system performance. For example, I recently implemented a hybrid recommendation approach that combines content-based filtering with matrix factorization, resulting in a 15% improvement in recommendation relevance based on user feedback.

            I am passionate about creating ethical, transparent, and user-centric AI systems that deliver meaningful value. Outside of work, I enjoy staying updated with the latest advancements in AI/ML, contributing to open-source projects like Hugging Face Transformers, and participating in technical communities such as Kaggle and Meetup groups. I am always open to connecting with professionals who share a passion for innovation and problem-solving.
